# 🎲 Dice Rolling Simulator (GUI)

This project is a Dice Rolling Simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python and the Tkinter library. The application simulates rolling two dice and displays the rolled numbers along with their sum.

The program uses Python’s random module to generate random values between 1 and 6 for each dice roll. A button is provided in the GUI, and when clicked, it triggers the dice roll and updates the result labels on the screen.

The project is designed to display dice images corresponding to the rolled numbers. Dice image filenames are mapped using a dictionary, which links each dice value to its respective image file. This helps in understanding how images can be dynamically updated in a GUI application.

This project is ideal for beginners to practice:

GUI development using Tkinter

Event handling with buttons

Random number generation

Basic use of images in Python GUI applications

The project can be further improved by fixing image loading, adding animations, or enhancing the layout for better user experience.
